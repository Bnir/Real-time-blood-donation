# Real Time Blood Donation Website (APP TOOO Kinda ðŸ˜‰) 

- Our platform is designed to effortlessly connect **Blood Donors** and **Requestors**, ensuring life-saving support is always just a few clicks away. With a simple **Email OTP-based signup**, users can register and choose their roleâ€”donor or requestor. Donors can leverage an **interactive map powered by Google Maps API** to mark hospitals where they are willing to donate, making the process location-specific and efficient.  

- For those in need, requesting blood is just as easy. By selecting a location radius, requestors can search for nearby donors and receive a list of hospitals along with the donor count at each location. Requests can then be sent directly to the hospital of their choice. Behind the scenes, all donors linked to the selected hospital are instantly notified via **Email**, **Web Push Notifications**, and **App Push Notifications**, ensuring timely responses.  

- Donors can manage requests through their **personal dashboard**, where they have the option to **accept** or **decline** requests. Accepted requests are automatically removed from other dashboards to prevent duplication. Once a donor accepts, they can view the requestorâ€™s phone number or start a **live chat** for further coordinationâ€”all while ensuring **privacy** by keeping phone numbers hidden until a request is accepted.  

- In emergencies, where thereâ€™s no time to register, our **SOS Request** feature comes to the rescue. Users can fill out basic details, select their location or hospital, and instantly **broadcast their phone number** to all donors within a **10 KM radius**. These urgent requests are prominently displayed on donor dashboards as **SOS cards**, ensuring maximum visibility and priority.  

- Whether itâ€™s a planned donation or a critical emergency, our platform is your one-stop solution to saving lives.

# FROM WEB TO APP: WEâ€™VE GOT YOU COVERED! ðŸš€
